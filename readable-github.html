			<h2>general guidelines</h2>
			<p>
				Writing clean and readable code is not hard, but it is very important towards
				the maintainability of your program. <br />
				Readability is achieved by through experience and practiced intuition, but can
				be guided by key principles including:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Good variable names.</strong>
					Every variable should have an identifier (name) that directly reflects what it 
					represents. A variable that is describing the number of ducks in a pond might 
					be called ducks or count but it shouldn't be called something like pancakes. 
					Never name your variables as single letters (except for counters in for loops) 
					or anything too abstract.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Function naming and responsibility.</strong>
					Make sure your functions also are named well represent what the function does. 
					Every function should also have a single responsibility, something you could 
					describe in a sentence or two. (This is called the SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY 
					PRINCIPLE).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Proper formatting.</strong>
					Always maintain correct and consistent indentation, spacing, and location of 
					curly braces, if required by the language. One of the most helpful motivations 
					for clean and consistent formatting is to consider the perspective of the 
					person trying to understand your code, making sure one could painlessly read 
					and interpret your code's purpose through a consistent organization and 
					hierarchal structure.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Clear documentation.</strong>
					You should provide clear documentation in all of your web development work, 
					describing functions, key variables or constants, and any particularly complex 
					sections of code. At the same time, your documentation should be 
					client-focused, avoiding implementation details about how your programs are 
					implemented (this latter point is especially relevant when working with 
					function-based programming languages like JavaScript and PHP).
				</li>

			<h2>commenting for cse 154</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>commenting your html and css code</h3>
				<p>
					The comment tag is used to insert comments in your HTML source code. Text 
					written inside of comment tags are not displayed by the browser.
					The comment tag is <code>&lt;!-- your comment here --&gt;</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The comments in CSS are wrapped between <code>/* your comment here */</code>. 
					Comments in HTML and CSS can also span multiple lines.
				</p>
				<div>
					<img src="https://webster.cs.washington.edu/images/hw01/htmlandcss.png" 
						alt="html and css comments" />
				</div>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>commenting your javascript code</h3>
				<p>There are two different ways to comment in JavaScript code:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Single-line comments:</strong>
						Including <code>//</code> in front of the single line of code that you want 
						to comment out.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Multi-line comments:</strong> 
						This method of commenting is exactly the same as commenting CSS files. You 
						insert multiple lines of code between the following: 
						<code>/* your comment here */</code>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					JavaScript is used <strong>boundlessly</strong> to develop huge applications 
					and Application Program Interfaces (APIs). Because of this, good documentation 
					of the application is necessary. To document our API's and applications, we use 
					a documentation generator called 
					<a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a>. <br />
					Some of the important <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> rules:
				</p>
				<ol id="lower-alpha-ol">
					<li>
						Each comment must start with a <code>/**</code> sequence in order to be 
						recognized by the <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> parser. 
						Comments beginning with <code>/*</code>, <code>/***</code>, or more than 
						3 stars will be ignored. This is to suppress parsing of comment blocks.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> tags to provide more 
						information about the code:
						<ul>
							<li>
								If the function to be commented is a constructor, then add a 
								<code>@constructor</code> tag to it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use <code>@param {data type}</code> to tag the parameters. Each 
								parameter gets a different tag and on a different line.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use <code>@return {data type}</code> to tag the return type for 
								the function. Explain what it represents in a sentence.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The comment should also include a single sentence description for 
						the function as well as for each parameter.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<div>
					<img src="https://webster.cs.washington.edu/images/hw01/jsdoc.png" 
						alt="jsdoc comment" />
				</div>
				<p>
					Though you are not required to for this class, you can generate the 
					documentation webpage, run the following command in a terminal window: 
					<code>jsdoc relative-path/book.js </code> <br />
					This command will create a directory named <code>out/</code> in the current 
					working directory. Within that directory, you will find the generated HTML 
					pages.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>commenting your php code</h3>
				<p>
					Commenting in PHP is exactly the same as commenting in JavaScript by using 
					<code>//</code> for single-line comments and <code>/* ... */</code> for
					multi-line comments.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Make sure to add the comment after the opening 
					PHP tag as shown below.
				</p>
				<div>
					<img src="https://webster.cs.washington.edu/images/hw01/php.png" 
						alt="php comment" />
				</div>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>commenting your sql</h3>
				<p>
					We're going to cut you some slack here... we don't require you to comment your 
					SQL code (It is pretty much self-explanatory, isn't it?).
				</p>

		<p>Now that you have read this document, make this quote your mantra:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				"Writing well-documented code is not only important for communicating with 
				others in your team. <br />
				It's also for communicating with yourself in the future."
			</p>
			<p>- Dr. Lauren Bricker</p>
